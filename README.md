# AR Anatomy Project 
Welcome to the AR Anatomy Project! This guide will walk you through the process of using our augmented reality application to explore 3D anatomical models. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Requirements 
To use the AR Anatomy Project, you will need:
 - A smartphone or tablet with a camera
 - The AR Anatomy app installed on your device
 - One of the provided target images (Included in this folder)

## Installation 
 1. Install the AR Anatomy App for Android, in the folder.

## Usage
1. Launch the App
   - Open the AR Anatomy app on your device.
2. Point Your Camera at the Target Image
   - Use your device's camera to scan one of the provided target images.
   - Ensure the entire image is within the camera's view for optimal detection.
3. View the 3D Model
   - Once the target image is recognized, a 3D anatomical model will appear on your screen.
   - Move your device around to view the model from different angles.

## Exploded View and Labeling 
1. Activate the Exploded View
   - Double tap (multi-touch) on the screen to toggle the exploded view of the 3D model.
   - In the exploded view, major parts of the anatomical model will separate and be     
     labeled for detailed examination.
2. Deactivate the Exploded View
   - Double tap (multi-touch) again to return the model to its original state.

## Troubleshooting
 - Model Not Appearing: Ensure the target image is fully visible and properly lit. Adjust the angle of your camera or try a different target image.
 - App Crashes: Restart the app and try again. Ensure your device is compatible and has the latest updates installed.
 - Exploded View Issues: If the exploded view does not activate or deactivate, make sure you are using the double tap gesture correctly.
